Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or 
otherwise modifying the original type. 
Extension methods are a special kind of static method, but they are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.



            using System;
            using ExtensionMethods;
            namespace ExtensionMethods
            {
                public static class MyExtensions
                {
                    public static int lettersCount(this String str)
                    {
                        return str.Length;
                    }
                }   
            }
            class Test{
                static void Main(){
                    String s = "hello";
                    int count = s.lettersCount();
                    Console.WriteLine(count);
                }
            }
