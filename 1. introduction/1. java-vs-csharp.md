#### c++ vs csharp
          1)  C++ is a general purpose, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, 
              procedural and generic programming. 	

              C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". 
              It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.

          2) 	In C++, multiple inheritance is possible through class. 	
              In C#, multiple inheritance is not possible through class.

          3) 	In C++, memory management is handled manually. 	
              In C#, memory management is handled automatically.

          4) 	In C++, pointers can be used anywhere in a program. 	
              In C#, pointers can be used only in unsafe mode.

          5) 	C++ programming is based on OOPs concept. 	
              C# programming is based on Component and OOPs concept.

          6) 	C++ is a programming language that runs on all platforms. 	
              C# is a programming language that rarely used outside Windows.

          7) 	C++ programming can be used to create console applications. 	
              C# programming can be used to create console applications, Windows applications, Mobile applications, etc.



#### java vs csharp
            1)  Java is a high level, robust, secured and object-oriented programming language developed by Oracle. 	
                C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.

            2) 	Java programming language is designed to be run on a Java platform, by the help of Java Runtime Environment (JRE). 	
                C# programming language is designed to be run on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

            3) 	Java type safety is safe. 	
                C# type safety is unsafe.


            4) 	In java, built-in data types that are passed by value are called primitive types. 	
                In C#, built-in data types that are passed by value are called simple types.

            5) 	Arrays in Java are direct specialization of Object. 	
                Arrays in C# are specialization of System.

            6) 	Java does not support conditional compilation. 	
                C# supports conditional compilation using preprocessor directives.

            7) 	Java doesn't support goto statement. 	
                C# supports goto statement.

            8) 	Java doesn't support structures and unions. 	
                C# supports structures and unions.


            9) 	Java supports checked exception and unchecked exception. 	
                C# supports unchecked exception.

    
    
    
#### c# and dot net

      The CLR is Microsoft's implementation of the CLI standard. 
      
      CLR is the execution environment in which a .NET application is safely hosted/run.    
                    
      C# is a programming language, 
      .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) 
      and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.
      
      
      The CLR is Microsoft's implementation of the CLI standard.
      CLI is a specification/set of guidelines that explains how to implement an application execution environment 
      
      clr : common language runtime : implementation(.net) : 
      cli : common language infrastructure : rules
      
      
####  Mono(implementation of cli) is an implementation of the .NET Framework for Linux


#### bottom line
        cli standard -> clr ( .net windows)
                      -> mono (linux)
