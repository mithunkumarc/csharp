#### var

          type inference : type decided by compiler
          
          
#### dynamic : takes any data : 
  
  
              dynamic d = 10;
              Console.WriteLine(d);
              d = "hello";
              Console.WriteLine(d);


           The compiler compiles dynamic types into object types in most cases. 
           The above statement would be compiled as:
              dynamic type at compile time:

              object dynamicVariable = 1;
