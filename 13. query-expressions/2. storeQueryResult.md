> A query is basically a set of instructions for how to retrieve and organize data. 

> Queries are executed lazily, as each subsequent item in the result is requested. 

> When you use foreach to iterate the results, items are returned as accessed. 

> To evaluate a query and store its results without executing a foreach loop, 
  just call one of the following methods on the query variable:

    ToList

    ToArray

    ToDictionary

    ToLookup

#### ToList

        using System.Linq;

                    1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
                };         

                IEnumerable<int> queryFactorsOfFour =
                from num in numbers
                where num % 4 == 0
                select num;
                foreach(var item in queryFactorsOfFour){
                    Console.WriteLine(item);
                }
                Console.WriteLine("converting to list");
                List<int> factorFourList =  queryFactorsOfFour.ToList();
                factorFourList.ForEach(n => Console.WriteLine(n));
            }
        }
        
        output :
