#### struct
> In C#, classes and structs are blueprints that are used to create instance of a class. 

> Structs are used for lightweight objects such as Color, Rectangle, Point etc.

> Unlike class, structs in C# are value type(stack) than reference type(heap). 

> struct does not implements inheritance
