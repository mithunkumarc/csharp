> deallocate memo allocated to object before program exits

> A destructor/Finalizers works opposite to constructor, It destructs the objects of classes. 

> It can be defined only once in a class. Destructor can't be public.

> Like constructors, it is invoked automatically. destructors called just before program exits.

> C# destructor cannot have parameters. Moreover, modifiers can't be applied on destructors.

#### destructor example code

        using System;  
        namespace classobjects  
        {            
            class Pen{
                public String name;
                public Pen(String name){
                    this.name = name;
                    Console.WriteLine($"{this.name} created");
                }

                ~Pen(){
                    Console.WriteLine($"{this.name} destroyed");
