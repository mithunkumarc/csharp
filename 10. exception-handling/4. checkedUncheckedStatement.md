C# statements can execute in either checked or unchecked context. 
In a checked context, arithmetic overflow raises an exception. 
In an unchecked context, arithmetic overflow is ignored and the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that don't fit in the destination type.

    checked Specify checked context.

    unchecked Specify unchecked context.
