#### casting and type conversion 	

#### casting : converting one type to another type if they are compatible

          int i = 10;
          String word = i;	//error

          eg : int to long, double to float 

#### Implicit conversions: 
          
          No special syntax is required because the conversion is type safe and no data will be lost.
          eg :int to long


#### Explicit conversions (casts): 
          
          Explicit conversions require a cast operator. 
          Casting is required when information might be lost in the conversion, or when the conversion might not succeed 
          for other reasons.

          eg: long to int : overflow may occur

#### class casting : class implicit conversion : 
          
          Animal base class and Dog child class 
          Dog d = new Dog();
          Animal a = d;

#### class explicit conversion : 

          Animal base class and Dog child class           
          Animal  a = new Dog();
          Dog d = (Dog)a;



### safely cast using is and as operators


#### is operator : returns true or false : checks whether an object can be cast to specific type

          using System;
          class Animal{

          }
          class Dog : Animal{

          }
          public class Test{
              static void Main(){
                  Animal a = new Animal();
                  //Animal a = new Dog();       //uncomment this and run
                  if(a is Dog){
                      Dog d = (Dog)a;
                      Console.WriteLine("a can be assigned to type dog");
                  }else{
                      Console.WriteLine("a cannot be assigned to type dog");
                  }    
              }
          }


####  as operator : same as is operator but return type is object or null


          using System;
          class Animal{

          }
          class Dog : Animal{

          }
          public class Test{
              static void Main(){
                  Animal a = new Animal();
                  //Animal a = new Dog();     //uncomment this and run
                  Dog result  = a as Dog;        
                  if(result!=null){
                      Dog d = (Dog)a;
                      Console.WriteLine("a can be assigned to type dog");
                  }else{
                      Console.WriteLine("a cannot be assigned to type dog");
                  }    
              }
          }
