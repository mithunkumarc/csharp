> Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type. 

> When the CLR boxes a value type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object and stores it on the managed heap. 

> Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. 

> Boxing is implicit; 

> unboxing is explicit. 



boxing : primitive(value) to object

int i = 123;


Object o = i; //implicit

Object o = (Object)i;//excplicit



unboxing : object to primitive(value)


int i = 123;      // a value type
object o = i;     // boxing
int j = (int)o;   // unboxing
