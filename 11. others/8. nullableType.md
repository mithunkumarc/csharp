> nullable type variable can have value of its type as well as null        
        
        
        //int i = null;// error , not a nullabe type
        int? i = null; // nullable type
        i = 10;
        //check whether variable i has value or not
        Console.WriteLine($"does var i has value? : {i.HasValue}");
        
        
#### example 2 : comparing with null value
            int? y = 7;
            if (y != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"y is {y.Value}");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("y does not have a value");
            }
            
#### nullable type to local variable

        int? i = null;
        //int j = i;//error , explicit conversion needed
        //int j = (int)i;//error, nullable type must have value
        i = 10;
        int j = (int)i;//works
