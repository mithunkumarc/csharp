> A process represents an application whereas a thread represents a module of the application. 

> Process is heavyweight component whereas thread is lightweight. 

> A thread can be termed as lightweight subprocess because it is executed inside a process.

> Whenever you create a process, a separate memory area is occupied. But threads share a common memory area.



##### There are following states in the life cycle of a Thread in C#.

1. Unstarted : When the instance of Thread class is created, it is in unstarted state by default. 
2. Runnable (Ready to run) : When start() method on the thread is called, it is in runnable or ready to run state.
3. Running : Only one thread within a process can be executed at a time. At the time of execution, thread is in running state.
4. Not Runnable :  if sleep() or wait() method is called on the thread, or input/output operation is blocked.
5. Dead (Terminated) : After completing the task, thread enters into dead or terminated state.


> The first thread which is created inside a process is called Main thread. It starts first and ends at last.
